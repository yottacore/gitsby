#!/usr/bin/env bash

#  shellcheck disable=1091  ## 'source is valid here, but shellcheck doesn't know the path to it.'

##	Purpose:
##		- Cuts a release end to end, so the steps that have been forgotten by hand
##		  cannot be. 'gitsby release' already does the git half well; this is
##		  everything around it.
##		- Three phases, so a failure never leaves a half-cut release:
##		   1. Prepare and verify. Runs the pipeline and cross-builds every release
##		      binary. Changes nothing outside the working tree, and nothing here
##		      needs undoing if it stops.
##		   2. Land. Writes the version, lands it through a PR, and calls
##		      'gitsby release'. The only phase that pushes.
##		   3. Publish and prove. Creates the GitHub release, uploads the binaries
##		      built in phase 1 and their checksums, then fetches one back and runs
##		      it - the result as a user would meet it.
##	Syntax:
##		cicd/release.bash [VERSION] [options]
##		  VERSION          e.g. v2.1.0. Omitted, the changelog's vNEXT heading and
##		                   'gitsby release' decide between them.
##		  -n, --dry-run    Say what each phase would do, change nothing. Use this.
##		  -y, --yes        Don't ask before phase 2.
##		  -q, --quiet      -y, and the pipeline run in phase 1 runs quiet too.
##		  -h, --help       This.
##	Notes:
##		- Refuses unless the tree is clean and you are on the merge target.
##		- The version lives in the tag and nowhere else. The binary carries it
##		  because the release build injects it, so there is no in-source version
##		  to bump and nothing that can disagree with the tag.
##		- Guards that have caught real mistakes: the harnesses must carry a
##		  history-footer entry newer than the last release tag, and the changelog
##		  must have a real vNEXT section rather than the decoy template heading.
##		- A version with a semver suffix - v3.0.0-beta.1 - publishes as a pre-release,
##		  so 'releases/latest' and both installers go on resolving to the newest full
##		  release. Asking for one is 'install.bash --tag v3.0.0-beta.1'.

##	History:
##		- 20260812 JC: Created, to the three-phase shape in project/design.md. The version bump, the
##		  changelog heading, the release body, the assets and the after-the-fact verification were
##		  all by hand, and each has been missed at least once. Both guards here exist because the
##		  thing they check has already gone wrong: the two builds' version strings drifting, and the
##		  in-script history footers going a whole release without an entry.
##		- 20260818 JC: The release binaries are built in phase 1, with the pipeline, rather than after the tag is pushed. A target that stops compiling now fails where nothing has been changed; found in phase 3 it would have left a pushed tag with no release behind it.
##		- 20260819 JC: The Windows resource is stamped with the version being cut - for the phase 1 build, then restored, and again in phase 2 where it lands in the bump commit. It is the only file left in the tree that names a version.
##		- 20260818 JC: Go. The version lives in the tag alone now - the build injects it - so phase 2 no longer bumps a string in two source files and phase 1 no longer has two of them to disagree. Phase 3 cross-builds the whole target matrix and publishes one binary per platform. The proof stopped being 'run both installers': there is one implementation, and what a user actually meets is a download, its checksum, and whether the thing runs.
##		- 20260813 JC: All three readings of the changelog start below the commented-out template.
##		  Each took the first match, so each found the template's decoy heading instead: the guard
##		  passed with nothing to release, the retitle rewrote the template and left the real section
##		  saying vNEXT, and the release body came out as the empty template plus a stray '-->' -
##		  non-empty, so the warning that exists for this never fired. The retitle is line-addressed
##		  now, and the template's heading is spelled TEMPLATE_vNEXT so either guard would do alone.
##		- 20260814 JC: Runs the pipeline engine that belongs to the platform. It always ran the Bash
##		  one, which knows nothing about Windows, so the gate a release most depends on would have
##		  been the wrong pipeline on half the machines this project supports.
##		- 20260814 JC: The installer proof retries. Cutting v2.1.0 warned that the release wasn't
##		  installable when it was - GitHub was still serving the tag without its assets, and the
##		  installer stops rather than skip verification. A warning that fires on a good release is
##		  worse than none, because the next one is read the same way.
##		- 20260821 JC: -q runs the release unattended, with the phase 1 pipeline quiet too.
##		- 20260826 JC: Phase 3 rebuilds the assets from the tagged commit, since the build number comes from that commit's date. The phase 1 build is only a compile gate now.
##		- 20260915 JC: The footer check covers every pipeline and installer script that keeps a history and changed since the last release, not only the two harnesses. Three pipeline files had gone a month without an entry. The notes' build line is the banner's first line, now that the copyright has a line of its own.
##		- 20260916 JC: A version with a semver suffix publishes as a pre-release. The tag decides it, since the tag is already the only thing that names a version. 'releases/latest' skips pre-releases by definition, so the phase 3 proof now checks that a candidate does NOT resolve there; the old check would have warned on every good one.
##		- 20260928 JC: A dry run no longer ends by saying the version was tagged, pushed and released. Committed executable, as its syntax line assumes.

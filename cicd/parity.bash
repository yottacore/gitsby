#!/usr/bin/env bash

##	Purpose:
##		- Backwards compatibility. Compares this build against the frozen v2.1.0
##		  script under legacy/, rather than each against a spec. cicd/test.bash
##		  asks "does this behave correctly?" of one build; this asks "does the new
##		  one ANSWER as the shipped one did?" for the same input.
##		- Aimed at the defect class the behavioral suite is blind to by
##		  construction: every port bug that has reached users here was a language
##		  mechanism differing - file encoding, argument parsing, return types,
##		  path resolution, string case - not a rule either build got wrong on
##		  purpose. A check written per implementation passes on both while they
##		  quietly disagree about the same input.
##		- Exits nonzero on any disagreement, so cicd aborts.
##	Syntax:
##		cicd/parity.bash
##	Notes:
##		- The reference is legacy/bin/gitsby, the Bash build. The PowerShell one is
##		  not a third leg: the two scripts were proven identical to each other at
##		  v2.1.0, so agreeing with one is agreeing with both, and a pwsh leg would
##		  only add an interpreter this has to find.
##		- Skips itself once legacy/ is gone: there is then nothing to compare to,
##		  and that is the intended end state, not a failure.
##		- Output is normalized only for the program's own name and for the absolute
##		  path of whichever build produced a line. Commands the new build renamed on
##		  purpose are compared under BOTH spellings, since the old one still has to
##		  work - anything else that differs is a finding.

##	History:
##		- 20260812 JC: Created. Compares the two builds against each other rather than each against
##		  a spec, for the defect class the behavioral suite cannot see: every port bug that reached
##		  users was a language mechanism differing, not a rule either build got wrong.
##		- 20260813 JC: Same environment isolation the behavioral suite grew: env-injected git config and an inherited gh token.
##		- 20260818 JC: Repointed. The pair used to be the two scripts; it is now this build against the frozen v2.1.0 one under legacy/, which is the question that still has an answer worth having. No pwsh leg: the two scripts were proven identical at v2.1.0, so agreeing with one is agreeing with both. The renamed commands are checked under both spellings, since the old name has to keep working.
##		- 20260819 JC: A difference used to end the run. diff exits 1, and under pipefail with -e that killed the script at the FIRST finding, so every later one went unreported - the totals line never printed either. Also a helper for comparing a line with one deliberate difference removed, spelled out per call so it cannot quietly widen.
##		- 20260926 JC: Every check carries a test ID at the front of its label.
##		- 20260926 JC: The pipeline no longer passes -q, so every check prints a line.
##		- 20261001 JC: Paths are escaped before going into a sed pattern. Off Windows the folder rule is written with symlinks resolved, since the frozen script never resolves them.

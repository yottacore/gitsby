#  shellcheck enable=require-variable-braces  ## Every expansion braced: "${var}", not "$var".

##	Purpose:
##		- Writes SHA256SUMS for a directory of release assets, named as the assets are
##		  named on the release, to stdout or a given file.
##		- Operates on the current directory, so it works the same for a release the
##		  pipeline built and for one assembled by hand:
##		      cd <asset dir> && cicd/utility/gen-checksums.bash SHA256SUMS
##		      gh release upload vX.Y.Z ./*
##		  Any existing SHA256SUMS is left out of its own listing.
##	History: At bottom of script.

##	History:
##		- 20260724: Created.
##		- 20260818: Checksums the directory it is run in rather than a hard-coded bin/ holding two scripts. A release is now one binary per platform, and the set changes with the target list.
##		- 20261004 JC: fEcho prints with printf. Every expansion braced, and shellcheck enforces it.

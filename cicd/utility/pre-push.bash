#!/usr/bin/env bash

#  shellcheck enable=require-variable-braces  ## Every expansion braced: "${var}", not "$var".

##	Purpose:
##		The git pre-push hook for this repo, and its installer.
##		- --install writes a small hook into the repo's hooks directory that runs this
##		  script on every push. It never sets core.hooksPath, and never replaces a hook
##		  it did not write.
##		- As the hook, a commit pushed to main gets cicd/cicd.bash --gate, run in a detached
##		  worktree at <git common dir>/gitsby-gate. The commit is checked as committed, never
##		  the working tree. A failure refuses the whole push.
##		- Other branches, deletes and tags are not gated. A commit whose cicd.bash has no
##		  --gate, and a box other than Linux, push with a note.
##	Syntax:
##		pre-push.bash --install
##		pre-push.bash <remote-name> <remote-url>   (as the hook: git's ref lines on stdin)
##	Exit: --install: 0 installed or already current, 1 refused, 2 usage.
##	      As the hook: 0 the push may go ahead, 1 refused.
##	History: At bottom of script.

## and writes its index - and the unit tests' throwaway repos resolve to the real one. Every
## git call here names its directory, and the gate should see what a hand run sees.

##	History:
##		- 20260914 JC: Created. It gates the commit being pushed, in a worktree of its own, rather
##		  than the working tree: uncommitted edits are routine here, and a push names a commit.
##		- 20260914 JC: The hook finds its checkout from where git started it when the push came from
##		  a subdirectory. A relative --work-tree had sent it to the directory above, ungated.
##		- 20260924 JC: Only a push to main is gated. Every other branch goes out without it.
##		- 20261004 JC: fEcho_Clean keeps its state in a two-underscore global and reads in one
##		  pass. Every expansion braced, and shellcheck enforces it.

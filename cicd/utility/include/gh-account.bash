#  shellcheck enable=require-variable-braces  ## Every expansion braced: "${var}", not "$var".

##	Purpose:
##		- Point gh at the account that belongs to wherever the pipeline is running, for this
##		  process only.
##		- gh keeps one active account per host. A pipeline that assumes it is the right one acts
##		  as whoever was last switched to, which against another account's repo either 404s or -
##		  worse - succeeds somewhere it should not have. 'gh auth switch' is the wrong fix for a
##		  script: it is global, it outlives the run, and a failure part-way leaves the machine
##		  switched.
##		- Configuration is read through git, so an includeIf on the repo path selects it - the
##		  same mechanism that already picks the ssh key and the commit identity. In
##		  ~/.gitconfig-<account>:
##		      [gitsby]
##		          ghAccount   = someaccount
##		          ghTokenFile = /path/to/token.txt
##		- Neither key is required, and nothing here fails when they are absent: an unconfigured
##		  checkout, a missing token file, or no gh at all all leave gh's own account in place.
##		  That is deliberate - a pipeline must not break on a box that was never set up this way.
##	Usage:
##		source "${here}/include/gh-account.bash"
##		fGhAccount_Select            ## exports GH_TOKEN when it can, silently no-ops when it can't
##		fEcho "Acting as $(fGhAccount_Active)"

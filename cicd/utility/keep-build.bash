#!/usr/bin/env bash

##	Purpose:
##		- Keeps timestamped copies of the built binary, and runs one of them, so a
##		  behavior change can be bisected against a build that predates it.
##		- Worth less here than in the projects this comes from: gitsby exits
##		  immediately, so nothing is ever held open and there is nothing to run
##		  "alongside" in the usual sense. What it is actually for is having last
##		  week's binary to hand when something answers differently than it used to.
##		- Archived copies are GFS-rotated, so the set stays bounded on its own.
##	Syntax:
##		cicd/utility/keep-build.bash                     Archive the current build.
##		cicd/utility/keep-build.bash --list              What is kept, newest last.
##		cicd/utility/keep-build.bash --run N [args ...]  Run kept build N (1 = newest).
##		cicd/utility/keep-build.bash --diff N [args ...] Run N and the current build on
##		                                                 the same arguments, and diff.
##	History: At bottom of script.

##	History:
##		- 20260819 JC: Created. The bisecting half of the profiling directive: gitsby exits
##		  immediately, so there is nothing to run alongside anything - what is actually
##		  wanted is last week's binary, and a diff of the two on the same arguments.
##		- 20261003 JC: A build number that is not digits is refused before arithmetic sees it.

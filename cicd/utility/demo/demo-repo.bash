#!/usr/bin/env bash

##	Purpose:
##		- Builds a throwaway, fully anonymized world for the demo gif: two git repos in
##		  two separate folder trees, a local bare "origin", and a gitsby config file that
##		  gives each tree its own GitHub account. The scenario beside this file drives
##		  real gitsby commands against it, so nothing about the demo can go stale.
##		- Everything is generic: a /tmp path with no username, a fake HOME + gitconfig,
##		  a made-up author, and pinned commit dates. Pinned dates keep commit hashes, and
##		  thus gitsby's output, identical run to run. With the release stamp cicd gives the
##		  demo's build, the gif bytes stay identical too, so cicd only regenerates the gif
##		  when the demo actually changes.
##		- Writes "$root/demo.env" holding the env the scenario steps source before each
##		  gitsby call.
##	Syntax: demo-repo.bash [ROOT]   (ROOT default: /tmp/gitsby-demo)
##	History: At bottom of script.

root="${1:-/tmp/gitsby-demo}"

##	HOME is the root itself, so the paths the demo prints and the "~/..." in its prompt
##	are the same place - the folder rules below are the point of the demo, and they read
##	as a lie if the two disagree.
##	The two trees differ from the first folder down ("dev" vs "code"). That is deliberate:
##	the account rules match on "github.com/<owner>" alone, so a demo whose trees shared a
##	root would not show that the match is a run of folder names anywhere in the path.
work="${root}/dev/github.com/acme-corp/acme-api"
side="${root}/code/github.com/mika-rivers/dotfiles"
bare="${root}/acme-api-origin.git"

##	Generic identity + fixed dates. Same values for every commit -> reproducible hashes.
##	A local-path remote means gitsby never runs ssh -G, so no real ssh/login identity
##	can leak into the rendered output.

##	ROOT is the only caller-supplied path in the tree that gets removed recursively, so it has to

##	Fake tokens. Their content is never read by anything the demo runs - a local-path remote
##	needs no credentials - but their presence is what makes gitsby report the account as
##	APPLIED rather than merely resolved, which is the state a real user would be in.

##	spend a line of every scene saying so about its own fixture.
chmod 600 "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/gitsby"/*.token

##	A stub gh, first on PATH. Two reasons, and the second is the important one:
##	  - gitsby asks GitHub whose token a tokenFile holds. A made-up token gets no answer, so
##	    every scene carried a line saying the token could not be checked.
##	  - the real gh would have answered as whoever is logged in on the rendering machine, which
##	    is a real name in a deliberately anonymized demo.
##	It answers only the two calls the scenario reaches and fails everything else, so a command
##	that grew a new gh call shows up as a visible failure rather than a plausible fake answer.

##	History:
##		- 20260724: v1.0. Anonymized offline repo builder for the demo gif.
##		- 20260814: Moved into cicd/utility/demo/, beside the scenario, the renderer and script.txt.
##		- 20260814: Builds two trees and a gitsby config, so the demo can show a folder deciding which account acts. HOME is the root, the trees differ from their first folder down, and demo.env now unsets the identity and config variables that would otherwise supply what the folder rules are meant to be supplying.
##		- 20260819: The fake tokens are 0600 and a stub gh goes first on PATH. Both were showing on camera: the permission warning on every scene, and the real gh answering as whoever is logged in on the machine doing the rendering.
##		- 20260813: ROOT is checked before it is removed. It was taken on trust and wiped first thing, so a mistyped or inherited argument cost whatever was there. Directories this script builds are stamped, and only a stamped one is removed.
##		- 20260914: The header names the second thing the gif's repeat rests on, the release stamp on the demo's build.

.SYNOPSIS
    Downloads and installs the gitsby binary for this platform.
.DESCRIPTION
    Shows the plan and asks first. Runs on Windows PowerShell 5.1 as well as PowerShell 7+,
    since 5.1 is what a fresh Windows install has; what it installs is a static binary and
    needs no PowerShell at all.

    Options:
        -Target user|system   Install for you (default) or for all users.
        -System               The same thing as -Target system.
        -Arch amd64|arm64     Which binary to fetch. Detected from this machine by default.
        -Tag TAG              A published release tag (default: the latest release).
        -Ref TAG              The older name for -Tag.
        -Yes                  Don't ask for confirmation.
        -Help                 Show the options and exit. '--help' works too.
        -Release stable       The older name for the default. -Release dev is gone.
    The Bash installer's spellings work as well, such as --target=system and --yes.

    The options are listed here rather than as parameter help. They belong to the function
    inside, since a script-level param() block breaks the iex one-liner.

# History:
#   - 20260722 JC: Created.
#   - 20260724 JC: Latest-release lookup via the releases/latest redirect (API scrape
#     is now the rate-limited fallback); random private temp dir; shebang sanity check;
#     release-asset downloads verify against a SHA256SUMS asset when published; named
#     parameters throughout; trailing blank line.
#   - 20260727 JC: Options now spelled -Release, -Target and -Arch, to match the other
#     installers. -System and -Ref still work.
#   - 20260727 JC: Body wrapped in a function: as top-level text the param() block never
#     bound (its ValidateSet validated its own empty default and died), a decline ended the
#     caller's session, and StrictMode leaked into it. Refuses at EOF instead of proceeding.
#     PowerShell 7 is now checked before anything reads $IsWindows.
#   - 20260728 JC: The failed-download message names '-Release dev', like install.bash's does. It used to send you to the Bash installer, which resolves the same stale release and fails the same way.
#   - 20260731 JC: SHA256SUMS is decoded from bytes before it's read. GitHub serves it as
#     octet-stream, so the response body arrived as a byte array and no checksum was ever
#     found - the default install path had been unverified since the check was added.
#   - 20260819 JC: Installs the binary for this platform, as gitsby.exe on Windows. -Arch is
#     real (it picks the asset) and -Ref is now -Tag, naming a release rather than any git
#     ref. -Release is bound only to explain itself. Every route is a release asset now, so
#     every route is verified and the unverified branch of the plan no longer exists.
#     SHA256SUMS is fetched before the plan is printed, because it is what says whether this
#     platform has a binary at all - and it names the ones that do when this one doesn't.
#   - 20260819 JC: Detection no longer lands back in -Arch and -Tag. Assigning to a parameter
#     re-runs its own validation, so an x86 box and a malformed scraped tag each died in the
#     binder instead of reaching the message written for them. PATH is now read raw from the
#     registry before it is rewritten - the expanded copy would have baked %USERPROFILE%-style
#     entries in as literals, for good, on a PATH we only meant to append to.
#   - 20260819 JC: Runs on Windows PowerShell 5.1: the three platform variables get a fallback,
#     TLS 1.2 is switched on, every web request asks for basic parsing, and the byte read is
#     spelled the way each version spells it. A fresh Windows box has 5.1 and nothing else, so
#     the documented one-liner could not work on the machine most likely to be running it.
#   - 20260819 JC: -Help, and '--help' with it - the README documented an option that did not
#     exist. The verification step reads $LASTEXITCODE, which nothing did: a native command's
#     nonzero exit does not trip $ErrorActionPreference, so a binary that would not run at all
#     was reported as installed. The binary is staged in the destination directory and renamed
#     over the target, since a move from the system temp is only atomic within one filesystem.
#   - 20260819 JC: The release fallback is one. Both routes asked releases/latest, which is
#     defined as the newest release that is NOT a pre-release - so on a repo whose newest
#     publication is one, the fallback failed exactly as the primary had, and blamed rate
#     limiting for it.
#   - 20260915 JC: The latest release is found on Windows PowerShell 5.1. There the redirect
#     came back as an error with no response, and the list behind it arrived as one item, so
#     every tag name made one tag. A system install that can't write its folder is refused
#     before the plan. The comment help lists the options, the Bash installer's long options
#     work, and a binary that can't start gets the "would not run" message. -Help lists -Ref,
#     errors have a blank line either side, and the plan says when it replaces a copy.
#   - 20260928 JC: A tag read from the release redirect gets the same path check as a typed
#     one. A user install checks it can write its folder before the plan. The binary is
#     installed 755 whatever the umask. The plan says when it creates the folder, and when it
#     clears copies an earlier install left behind.

#!/usr/bin/env bash

##	Purpose:
##		- Downloads and installs the gitsby binary for this platform, after showing the
##		  plan and asking first. Meant for one-liner use:
##		      curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yottacore/gitsby/main/install.bash | bash
##		  Flags go after 'bash -s --', e.g.:
##		      ... | bash -s -- --system -y
##		- Runs on bash 3.2+ (stock macOS bash), so no bash-4/5 features in here. What it
##		  installs is a static binary and needs no shell at all.

##	History:
##		- 20260722 JC: Created.
##		- 20260724 JC: Latest-release lookup via the releases/latest redirect (API scrape is now the rate-limited fallback); release-asset downloads verify against a SHA256SUMS asset when published; trailing blank line.
##		- 20260727 JC: Options now spelled --release, --target and --arch, to match the other installers. -s/--system and --ref still work.
##		- 20260812 JC: The plan says whether the download will be checked, before it is agreed to. It was reported only afterwards, and on the --release dev path not at all - so the one route that installs an unverified file was the quiet one.
##		- 20260819 JC: Installs the binary for this platform. --arch is real (it picks the asset) and --target is unchanged; --release is gone, since a branch has no build behind it. Every route is a release asset now, so every route is verified and the unverified branch of the plan no longer exists. SHA256SUMS is fetched before the plan is printed, because it is what says whether this platform has a binary at all. Windows is sent to install.ps1, which is the one that also handles PATH.
##		- 20260819 JC: The release lookup no longer takes the run out with it. Under 'set -e' an assignment carries its command's status, so a curl that failed - or a wget that answered a declined redirect with exit 8, having already printed the very header it was sent for - ended the install silently, past the fallback and past the message that explains it.
##		- 20260819 JC: The release fallback is one. Both routes asked releases/latest, which GitHub defines as the newest release that is NOT a pre-release - so on a repo whose newest publication is one, the fallback failed in exactly the way the primary had, and blamed rate limiting for it. The list endpoint answers instead, newest first, preferring a full release and saying so when only a candidate exists.
##		- 20260819 JC: The binary is staged in the destination directory and renamed over the target. Written in place, an interrupt mid-copy left a truncated executable that had passed its checksum under another name, and re-installing over a copy that was running failed outright. --help lists every option the parser accepts.
##		- 20260915 JC: SHA256SUMS is read with either case of hash and with CRLF line ends. --help lists --ref, and says --release stable still names the default. The no-binary refusal, a declined prompt and the pre-release notice have a blank line either side. The plan says when it replaces a copy, and a binary that won't run is named with its exit code.
##		- 20260928 JC: End of input at the prompt says Aborted, as a typed no does. A tag read from the release redirect gets the same path check as a typed one. A user install checks it can write its folder, and a system one that sudo exists, both before the plan.
##		- 20261003 JC: The hash lookup reads SHA256SUMS to the end. A head that quit at the first match could fail the write before it, and the install ended with nothing said.
##		- 20261003 JC: A Mac takes gitsby-darwin-universal, one binary for both CPUs, in place of one per CPU. --arch there is noted and changes nothing.

## What it is

Git has more than eighty porcelain commands, because it supports every workflow, every team size, and every hard edge-case of conflict resolution. That flexibility is the whole reason it's complex.

Gitsby has nine - or 22 counting subcommands. It gets there three ways:

- By applying one opinionated workflow and ignoring the myriad other ways of doing the same thing.

- By accepting that arguably 90% of Git's complexity covers about 10% of use-cases, and purposely leaving those alone. Not pretending they never happen - just not trying to be the tool that solves them when they do.

- By orienting commands around *goals* ("what do I want to happen with these changes?") rather than around administrative tasks. So Gitsby commands don't map 1:1 onto Git commands; they line up with what you were actually trying to do, which is usually several Git commands and a decision or two in between.

Gitsby does nothing a skilled Git user can't do directly - just with far fewer chances to make one of the expensive mistakes.

Every command aims to be safe (never risk losing work, yours or anyone's), idempotent, tolerant of a previous command having been half-finished, and forgiving - run any of them at any time, and if it doesn't make sense it won't damage anything.

The full list of opinions, and how the workflow lines up against GitFlow, GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow, and trunk-based development, is in [workflows.md](workflows.md).

## Commands

What you reach for daily is a one-word command. Everything else is grouped under a noun, so the whole set is discoverable from a handful of starting points. `repository` and `branch` spell out if you prefer them.

| Command              | Args          | What it does
| :--                  | :--           | :--
| `update`             | `[msg]`       | Pull updates, then commit all local changes. Do frequently!
| `sync`               | `[msg]`       | Pull, commit, and push. Do infrequently.
| `status`             |               | Fetch and show current status.
| `release`            | `[ver]`       | Cut a release: merge `dev` into `main`, tag, push. No version: the next one after the latest tag.
| `br`                 |               | Fetch and list branches (`br list` is the same thing).
| `br create`          | `<branch>`    | Create a new branch off `dev`/`main`. Uncommitted work on `dev`/`main` comes along; on another branch it is parked there first.
| `br hotfix`          | `<name>`      | Branch off the default branch as `hotfix/<name>`, to correct what's already published. Landing it carries the change back to `dev`.
| `br switch`          | `[branch]`    | Switch to a branch (parks current work first). No arg: back to `dev`/`main`.
| `br land`            | `[msg]`       | Merge the current branch into `dev`/`main` (`--no-ff`), push, delete it local + remote.
| `br prune`           |               | Delete branches already merged into `dev`/`main`, local + remote. Unmerged ones, and the branch you're on, are kept.
| `repo clone`         | `<url> [dir]` | Clone a repo you don't have yet (checks out `dev` if it has one). Re-run is a no-op.
| `repo create`        | `<owner/name>`| `git init` if needed, commit, then create the GitHub repo via [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) and push to it (`--public`/`--private`; private by default).
| `repo connect`       | `[target]`    | Publish local work to a remote that already exists and is empty: `git init` if needed, commit, push. Takes a URL or `owner/name`.
| `repo url`           | `[https\|ssh]` | Show how `origin` authenticates, or switch it between the two. Nothing else about the repo changes.
| `pr`                 |               | Lists PRs via [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli).
| `pr <#>`             |               | View a PR plus its diff.
| `pr create`          | `[title]`     | Push the current branch and open a PR against `dev`/`main` (no title: the last commit subject).
| `pr ok`              | `<#>`         | Approve and merge a PR.
| `account`            |               | Show your configured GitHub accounts, and which one this folder uses (`account list` is the same thing).
| `account apply`      |               | Teach plain `git` the same folder rules, so `git` outside Gitsby behaves identically.
| `raw git`            | `<args ...>`  | Run `git` as the account this folder belongs to. Everything after `git` is git's, verbatim.
| `raw gh`             | `<args ...>`  | The same, for `gh`.

There is deliberately no bare `commit` and no bare `pull`. Committing without sharing is how work quietly diverges, and pulling without committing is the one thing the rest of the tool never does.

`br create`, `br switch`, `br land`, and `pr create` all deal with your work first. `update` is the one command for both, and it pulls *before* it commits so your work lands on top of everyone else's and history stays linear.

`br prune` deletes a branch only when its tip is provably an ancestor of the merge target, re-checked at the moment of each delete - not `git branch -d`'s upstream-containment test, which answers a different question and gets it wrong in both directions. That exactness is what the workflow buys: every branch lands with a real merge commit, so "merged" is a fact, not a guess. Unmerged work always survives it, and there is deliberately no `--force`.

Options: `-m MSG` (commit/merge message, or give it positionally), `-q`/`-y` (assume yes; no prompts), `--public`/`--private` (visibility for `repo create`; private by default), `--no-fetch` (skip the fetch and the pull), `--any-identity`, `--config FILE` (read accounts from somewhere other than the usual place), `-h`, `-v`.

The PowerShell version takes the same options in PowerShell form: `-Message MSG`, `-Quiet`/`-y`, `-Public`/`-Private`, `-NoFetch`, `-AnyIdentity`, `-Config FILE`, `-Help`, `-Version`. Commands and arguments are spelled identically in both.

**Offline is a state, not a flag.** Every command finds out by trying, and then behaves:

- The ones that mean something locally still work. `update` commits; `br create`, `br switch` and `br land` do their branch work. Each says what it skipped, and that `sync` will publish it later.

- The ones that exist to publish - `sync`, `pr create`, `pr ok`, `release` - refuse up front and say what to do instead. None of them fails halfway through, and none reports success having sent nothing.

**Publishing a directory shows you the directory first.** `repo create` and `repo connect` list every file they are about to publish, before asking. The list is what `git add --all` will actually add, `.gitignore` and all - so a stray `.env` is visible while you can still say no.

## Multiple GitHub accounts

Most people with two GitHub accounts also have a folder for each: one tree for work, one for everything else. Gitsby takes that literally. Say which account owns which folder, once, and every command run anywhere under that folder acts as that account - `git` and `gh` alike.

~~~ini
# ~/.config/gitsby/config.shcl

account.work.path       = ~/dev/work
account.work.ghAccount  = my-work-login
account.work.email      = ada@work.example

# Or name folders instead of a root, and the same file works on every machine
account.personal.pathContains = github.com/my-personal-login
account.personal.ghAccount    = my-personal-login
account.personal.email        = ada@home.example
~~~

Over HTTPS each account authenticates with its own token - the one `gh` already stores - so a second account costs one `gh auth login` and three lines of config, with no SSH keys and no `~/.ssh/config` host aliases baked into remote URLs. `gitsby account apply` writes the same rules into your global git config as ordinary `includeIf` blocks, so plain `git` agrees with Gitsby even when Gitsby isn't involved. `gitsby raw git ...` runs any git command as the folder's account, so existing scripts become account-correct by prefixing rather than rewriting.

Nothing here is required. With no configuration Gitsby uses whichever account `gh` is logged in as, exactly as it always did. A single-account machine never notices the feature exists.

Full detail, including SSH keys, token files, and how Gitsby checks that `gh` and `git` agree about who you are: [accounts.md](accounts.md).

## Compatibility

- Gitsby, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli), [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), and [Tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) are all compatible, interchangeable, and can be intermixed on the same project at any time without interference. That makes trying Gitsby cheap - you don't need to commit to anything. (No pun intended.)

	> Note: [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com/) is *not* interchangeable with these. While a great tool and a cool idea, it manages its own metadata - that inherently doesn't mix well with other git-based tools that move `HEAD` or rewrite history. It's worth a look, but give it a dedicated trial on a small personal repo rather than mixing it in.

- Gitsby works with any Git remote, GitHub and GitLab included. The exceptions go through [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) and are therefore GitHub-only: the `pr` commands, `repo create`, and `repo connect` when you give it an `owner/name` instead of a URL.

- What you need: Git, plus either bash 4.4 or newer (for `gitsby`) or PowerShell 7 or newer (for `gitsby.ps1`). The two builds are interchangeable - same commands, same results - so on a machine without bash, the PowerShell one is a complete substitute.

	- Linux: bash is already new enough on anything current.

	- macOS: stock `/bin/bash` is 3.2 from 2007. `brew install bash` or `sudo port install bash` puts a current one alongside it rather than over it, so the new one has to come first on your `PATH`.

	- BSD ships no bash at all, but it's trivially easy to remedy: `pkg install bash` on FreeBSD, `pkg_add bash` on OpenBSD.

	- Windows: use the PowerShell build, or the Bash one under WSL.

	Gitsby tells you which of these applies if it can't run, rather than failing with a shell error.

- Your default branch can be called anything. Gitsby asks the remote what it is, and falls back to `main`, `master`, or `trunk` locally - or to your only branch, in a repo that has just one. If it genuinely can't tell, it says so and stops instead of guessing, and `git remote set-head origin --auto` is usually the one-line fix.

## A typical day

~~~bash
## Day zero: get the repo
gitsby repo clone git@github.com:my-github-user/my-project.git

## Or to publish work that only exists locally
gitsby repo create my-github-user/my-project

## Branch off dev (or main), publish it
gitsby br create Feature1

## ...Do work...

## Commit + pull; do this all day long
gitsby update "wip"

## Also push, when ready to share to the upstream branch
gitsby sync

## Merge into dev (--no-ff), push, delete the branch
gitsby br land "Add Feature1"
~~~

Every mutating command fetches first, shows you the repo state and the exact git commands it is about to run, and asks before touching anything.

## Install

### Is it in my package manager?

Not yet - nothing on apt, dnf, Homebrew or winget. The two one-liners below are the supported route.

### The one-liners

~~~bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install.bash | bash
~~~

~~~pwsh
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install.ps1 | iex
~~~

The first installs the Bash build, the second the PowerShell one. You need Git, plus bash 4.4+ or PowerShell 7+ to match - each build is a script, so its runtime is the one thing it needs.

`iex` can't pass options along. To hand the PowerShell installer a flag, give the same download to a script block instead:

~~~pwsh
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install.ps1))) -Target system
~~~

Either one shows you its plan and asks before touching anything. By default it takes the latest full release and checks the download against that release's published `SHA256SUMS`. Asking for a branch or tag instead pulls straight from the tree, which has no published checksum, and the plan says which of the two you are about to get.

### Where it goes

It installs for you alone unless told otherwise:

| Platform            | You (the default)                | Everyone
| :--                 | :--                              | :--
| Linux, macOS, BSD   | `~/.local/bin`                   | `/usr/local/bin`
| Windows             | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\gitsby` | `%ProgramFiles%\gitsby`

On Windows the PowerShell installer also puts that directory on your PATH, since nothing else there will, and says so in the plan. Open a new shell afterwards to pick it up.

For anything else - installing for everyone, or taking the tip of `dev` rather than the latest release - the Bash installer lists its options under `--help`, and the PowerShell one takes `-Target system`, `-Release dev`, `-Ref <branch-or-tag>` and `-Yes`.

## How to develop

One-liner dev setup: clones the repo into `./gitsby`, checks out the `dev` branch, and checks (optionally installs) the dev tooling.

~~~bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install-dev.bash | bash
~~~

~~~pwsh
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install-dev.ps1 | iex
~~~

Once it's cloned, `cicd/cicd.bash` is the local pipeline and the one command to know. Run it before opening a PR. It fast-forwards from origin first, so everything after it tests the tree that is actually going out, then runs the lint stage, the regression tests, the fuzz vectors, a dogfood install and a demo gif rebuild.

**It ends by committing and pushing** - worth knowing before you run it on a fork. `--no-publish` stops short of that.

~~~bash
cicd/cicd.bash --quick          # skips fuzz and the demo gif; what you want while iterating
cicd/cicd.bash                  # everything, and it prompts once for a commit message
cicd/cicd.bash -y -m "message"  # unattended
~~~

`cicd/cicd-win.ps1` is the same six stages natively on Windows, with the options in PowerShell spelling (`-Quick`, `-Yes -Message "..."`, `-NoPublish`). Any stage whose tooling isn't installed reports itself absent and is skipped, so a missing `pwsh` or `gifsicle` won't stop the rest.

Full prerequisites and process: [contributing.md](contributing.md). Coding style: [style-guide.md](style-guide.md). There's also "[Git notes and one-liners](git_notes_and_oneliners.md)", covering simplified versions of what Gitsby does - useful when you want the raw commands.

## Contributing

Given that you may be using this for mission-critical work (as I do), Gitsby aims to be bulletproof, unsurprising, and useful, in that order. It is currently simple enough that the first two are attainable, and they're believed met now - through manual QA, an automated suite that runs every check against both implementations, and near-daily use.

Given how it's written, even if a feature fails its design, it should in theory still never compromise your work.

But if you find something that doesn't work as advertised, or behaves in a way you find surprising even if as-designed, please file an issue. Contributions are welcome too - start with [contributing.md](contributing.md).

## Support Gitsby

Gitsby is free, and built and maintained in spare time. If it helps but code and bug reports aren't your thing, a star or a mention still helps other people find it - and if it is saving you real time, sponsorship through [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/jim-collier) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jimcollier) is welcome, and never expected.
